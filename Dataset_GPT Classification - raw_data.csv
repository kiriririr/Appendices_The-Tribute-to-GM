"I refactored a bigger chunk of the code when I was moving Strategy trait over from masking, because I realized that there would otherwise be two places for CardNumber, the new one in crates/cards and the one that was in common_utils:pii. Since quite a few places were using common_utils:pii::CardNumber i replaced that everywhere with the new cards::CardNumber. I also moved the test regarding masking of CardNumber to cards::validate. Creating a secret from a valid and a non valid CC number works when specifying Strategy of CardNumber:
When creating a CardNumber the inner value is a StrongSecret which uses the WithType Strategy per default which seems to work as well.
Still not really sure how to use the error properly, i.e. what to do in the masking case when the CC number is not valid. Right now it's masked just as a valid CC number.
Also I wasn't sure what you meant by this.
Let me know if this works for you and what to change. Or if this is too much I can always go back to the previous commit and just add the stuff that you mentioned in your earlier comment.",Clarifying,"- Problem
