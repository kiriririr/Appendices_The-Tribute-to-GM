(Because the only reason I could imagine DispatchOne() only dispatching a single item is to avoid event loop starvation.)",approval,solution

"Yes WebSecurityPolicy is only meant to be accessed on the renderer side and the RendererClientBase::RenderThreadStarted is ideal point to invoke it, mainly because the policies need to be configured before the document starts loading.",clarifying,
Reason I asked the api to be on session is because the origin list can be shared across different webContents using similar session.

"If the app was first signed with the developer certificate, then you replace that app executable with another one signed by your certificate, it will fail the check.",clarifying,
"However, if you have access to the original signing key, of course it will bypass any validation since you are signing the whole package including malicious code and replacing the other package.",clarifying,

Looks like the cause of the hangs is that session_->Emit() is being called on the IO thread (all JS in Electron in the main process must be run on the UI thread).,solution,

You can simply run the test in a loop to see it fail. For example:,solution,
"If the test fails because the leveldb is smaller than the block files, I would propose keeping the randomization for the block files and adding a second deterministic test for leveldb?",solution,
"So there are smaller ldb files that are perturbed first that don't trigger the issue, it's actually a bigger one where the failure happens.",solution,
I guess there are two possible approaches:,solution,
Maybe do 1. for 26.0 and 2. for 27.0?,solution,
"Edit: Hmm, I think just having a boolean option to say ""write version 1 mempool.dat"" is enough. If there are any users that need ""use 0 for all random numbers"", they can create a feature request after they read the release notes.",solution,
It is. You can simply set -persistmempoolv1=1.,solution,
I'd say to just leave the code logic as it was before and only change the string,solution,
"What could be added, however, is a check for 127.0.0.1 and 127.1.",solution,
